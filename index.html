      <h1>Design for Good Interview Questionnaire, a student portfoilo research piece</h1>
      <br>
      <h4> Thank you for your interest in providing feedback for my research study.<h4>
        <p>Many American's fall on hard, even desperate times, largely through no fault of their own; It is estimated that 68% of Americans are one financial emergency away from finanacial ruin.</p
        <p>One hospital bill, one car repair, one unexpected expense. <p>
        <p>My goal with this short questionnaire is to use the ideas for improving the systems, to actually improve the systems.</p>
        <p>Right now in the US, technology is evolving at an unprecedented speed. New User Experience designers are learning how to build the world of tomorrow, and reimagine the world of today. That's where your feed back comes in!</p>
        <p>As a User Experience Design student myself, I have found numerus design idea generators online, but all of them are things like "design a landing page for your favorite restaurant", rather than "improve your local DSS web site.'</p>
        <p> with your help I will be creating a design idea generator, that gives design prompts for good!</p>
        <p>This way, the voices of those who use these services will finally be heard.</p>
        <br>
        <h5>Think of a time you have had to access or apply for a social program, either emergency or not, and the roadblocks or barriers you were met with along the way. These are the things that will be the focus of our interview.</h5>
